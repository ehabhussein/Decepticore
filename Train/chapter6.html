            <h2>6.2 Detailed Explanation of Training Parameters</h2>
            
            <h3>6.2.1 Auto Find Batch Size</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A feature that automatically determines the optimal batch size for training based on available hardware resources and model architecture.</p>
            <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong> This parameter leverages an iterative process to find the largest batch size that can fit in memory. It starts with a small batch size and gradually increases it until it encounters an out-of-memory error, then selects the last successful batch size.</p>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to Check Effectiveness:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor GPU memory usage (should be close to maximum without errors)</li>
                    <li>Compare training speed with manual batch size settings</li>
                    <li>Observe stability of training metrics over time</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Potential Pitfalls:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>May not always find the truly optimal batch size for learning</li>
                    <li>Could lead to suboptimal convergence if batch size is too large</li>
                    <li>Might not account for memory used by other processes on the same GPU</li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Advanced Considerations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider using in combination with gradient accumulation for even larger effective batch sizes</li>
                    <li>Be aware that optimal batch size for memory usage may not be optimal for model convergence</li>
                    <li>For multi-GPU setups, ensure it properly distributes across all available devices</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>6.2.2 Chat Template</h3>

                    <li><strong>tokenizer:</strong> When you want to rely on the model's built-in tokenization and formatting.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures consistency between training data format and model's expected input</li>

            </p>

            <h3>6.2.3 Disable Gradient Checkpointing (GC)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An option to turn off the gradient checkpointing technique, which trades computation for memory savings during backpropagation.</p>
            <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong> Gradient checkpointing works by saving activations at certain layers (checkpoints) and recomputing them during backpropagation, rather than storing all activations. Disabling it means all activations are stored, which uses more memory but can speed up training.</p>
            <p><strong>When to Use:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you have sufficient GPU memory to store all activations</li>
                    <li>For smaller models or datasets where memory isn't a constraint</li>
                    <li>When training speed is a priority over memory efficiency</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Can significantly speed up training by avoiding recomputation</li>
                    <li>Simplifies the computational graph, which can be beneficial for certain optimizations</li>
                    <li>Allows for larger batch sizes if memory permits</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to Check Effectiveness:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compare training speeds with GC enabled vs. disabled</li>
                    <li>Monitor GPU memory usage in both scenarios</li>
                    <li>Evaluate if larger batch sizes are possible with GC disabled</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Potential Pitfalls:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can lead to out-of-memory errors for large models or datasets</li>
                    <li>May not be suitable for multi-GPU training with limited memory per GPU</li>
                    <li>Could limit the maximum model size that can be trained on a given hardware</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Advanced Considerations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider using a hybrid approach where GC is selectively applied to certain layers</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the trade-off between training speed and maximum model size</li>
                    <li>For very large models, keeping GC enabled might be the only feasible option</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    <li><strong>epoch:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>For smaller datasets where epochs don't take too long</li>
                            <li>When you want a consistent evaluation schedule relative to data size</li>
                            <li>If your metric calculations are computationally expensive</li>
                        </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows for timely detection of overfitting or underfitting</li>
                    <li>Enables implementation of early stopping to prevent overtraining</li>
                    <li>Provides regular checkpoints for model performance</li>
                    <li>Helps in adjusting hyperparameters during training</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>When deploying models where adapter switching is not needed</li>
                    <li>To simplify the model architecture for inference</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong>
